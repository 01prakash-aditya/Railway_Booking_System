🚆 INDIAN RAILWAY SYSTEM
An SQL-based simulation of the Indian Railway Ticketing System, built with stored procedures, triggers, and a comprehensive relational schema to mimic real-world functionalities like booking, cancellations, wallet management, and admin control.

🧩 Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
The ER diagram below illustrates the database design and relationships between key tables in the system:

ER Model

🧾 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project replicates the Indian Railways' booking infrastructure. It features:

User registration, authentication, and wallet-based transactions
Train search, seat booking with RAC/WL management
Automatic seat promotion on cancellations
Admin operations for populating and managing train data
📦 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
Database Setup:
Execute the SQL scripts (train.docx contents) in your MySQL Workbench or CLI to create all tables, triggers, and procedures.

Initial Train Data:
Train and coach data are inserted as part of the setup. You can use CALL sp_PopulateSeatsForDate('YYYY-MM-DD'); to generate daily seat data.

👤 USER FUNCTIONS
Feature	Procedure	Description
Register New User	sp_CreateUser	Create user and insert payment details
Login	sp_UserLogin	Authenticate user using username + DOB (as password)
Add Payment Method	sp_AddPaymentMethod	Add card or UPI credentials
Load Wallet	sp_WalletOperation	Use with operation = 'add' to load balance
Search Trains	sp_SearchTrains	Search trains between stations on a date
Check Train Availability	sp_TrainAvailability	View timing, schedule, and stops
Book Ticket	sp_BookTicket1	Book seat; auto-assigns Confirmed, RAC or WL
View Bookings	sp_ViewUserBookings	Filter by status and journey date
Check PNR Status	(use Tickets table)	Check via PNR column in Tickets
Cancel Ticket	sp_CancelTicket	Auto-promotes RAC/WL and refunds to wallet or original method
Logout	sp_UserLogout	Dummy call for session end
Note:

Refunds: 90% of fare refunded on cancellation
RAC → Confirmed and WL → RAC on cancellations
Ensure wallet balance is sufficient before booking
🛠 ADMINISTRATOR PANEL
Task	SQL / Procedure	Description
Generate Seats for Today	CALL sp_GenerateSeats();	Creates default seat layout for all coaches
Populate Seats for a Date	CALL sp_PopulateSeatsForDate('YYYY-MM-DD');	Create seat entries for future dates
Add New Train / Schedule	INSERT INTO Trains ... etc.	Add entries to Trains, TrainSchedule, etc.
View All Tickets	SELECT * FROM Tickets;	View every booking
View All Passengers	SELECT * FROM Passengers;	Individual passenger details
View All Transactions	SELECT * FROM Transactions;	Payment and refund history
View Wallets and Balances	SELECT * FROM EWallet;	Track wallet balance per user
View Cancellations	SELECT * FROM Cancellation;	Check refund info and cancellation logs
⚙ INTERNAL LOGIC (Triggers)
trg_create_ewallet: Creates a wallet when user registers
trg_process_refund: Auto-refunds wallet on cancellation
trg_wallet_payment: Deducts from wallet during booking
trg_update_passenger_status: Marks passengers as cancelled when ticket is cancelled
🧭 HOW TO USE (User Journey)
Register a new user using sp_CreateUser
Add funds using sp_WalletOperation
Search trains with sp_SearchTrains
Check stops and timings using sp_TrainAvailability
Book using sp_BookTicket1
View your tickets with sp_ViewUserBookings
Cancel using sp_CancelTicket if needed
🔮 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
✅ Multi-passenger ticket booking support
✅ Email/SMS simulation for PNR alerts
⏳ Auto-scheduling of seats for future days via scheduler event
❌ Authentication with encrypted password support (currently DOB-based)
📈 Admin dashboard (GUI/Web or CLI-based)
📦 Integration with live train data APIs (IRCTC/NTES)
🧠 AI-assisted dynamic pricing (e.g., surge fare, route popularity)
🔐 Session-based authentication & token management
