# Railway Reservation System

A comprehensive simulation of the Indian Railway Ticketing System built with MySQL, featuring stored procedures, triggers, and a relational database schema to implement real-world functionalities including reservations, cancellations, payment processing, and administrative controls.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

The diagram below illustrates the database design and relationships between entities in the system:

## Project Overview

This project implements a digital replica of the Indian Railways' reservation infrastructure with the following features:

- User account management with secure authentication
- Electronic wallet for seamless transactions
- Advanced train search functionality
- Reservation system with automatic seat allocation
- Support for RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) and Waitlist management
- Dynamic seat promotion upon cancellations
- Administrative interface for system management

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Initialization**:
   - Execute the SQL scripts in MySQL Workbench or command-line interface to create the database schema, including tables, triggers, and stored procedures.

2. **Data Population**:
   - Initial train and coach data are included in the setup scripts.
   - Generate daily seat inventory using: `CALL sp_PopulateSeatsForDate('YYYY-MM-DD');`
